    conceptSlug: "event-loop",
    title: "Implement debounce",
    description: `**Debounce** delays running a function until the user *stops* triggering it. It's the standard fix for "this is firing way too often."

## The problem

Picture a search box that calls an API on every keystroke. Type **india** and you fire five requests — for \`i\`, \`in\`, \`ind\`, \`indi\`, \`india\` — but only the last one matters. The other four are wasted bandwidth and server load, and a slow earlier response can even land *after* the final one and overwrite it.

## The idea

A debounced function waits for quiet. Every new call **resets a timer**; the real work only runs once \`delay\` milliseconds pass with no new calls. Type fast, pause, and a single request fires.

## Your task

Write \`debounce(fn, delay)\` that returns a new function which:

- delays calling \`fn\` until \`delay\` ms have passed since the **last** call
- forwards the latest arguments and \`this\` to \`fn\`
- exposes a \`.cancel()\` method that throws away any pending call

\`\`\`js
const search = debounce((q) => fetch("/api?q=" + q), 300);
search("i"); search("in"); search("ind");
// only "ind" runs, 300ms after the last call
search.cancel(); // ...unless you cancel first
\`\`\`

> **Debounce vs throttle:** debounce waits for a pause (great for search, resize, autosave). Throttle runs at a steady maximum rate (great for scroll handlers). Different tools for different jobs.

    title: "Virtualized list windowing",
    description: `**Virtualization** (or "windowing") renders a huge list at 60fps by only mounting the rows you can actually see — a few dozen, not thousands.

## The problem

Render 10,000 rows the naive way and the browser creates 10,000 DOM nodes. Every scroll, re-render, and layout has to walk all of them, so the page stutters and memory balloons — all to show about a dozen rows at a time.

## The idea

The screen only fits a handful of rows, so mount *only those* and swap them as the user scrolls. The trick is the **windowing math**: given the scroll position, which row indices are on screen right now? You keep one tall spacer the full height of the list (so the scrollbar stays honest) and absolutely-position the visible rows inside it.

## Your task

Write \`visibleRange(scrollTop, rowHeight, containerHeight, totalRows, overscan)\` returning \`{ start, end }\` — the **inclusive** index range of rows to mount:

- the first visible row is \`Math.floor(scrollTop / rowHeight)\`
- the last is \`Math.floor((scrollTop + containerHeight) / rowHeight)\`
- pad the range by \`overscan\` rows on each side so fast scrolls don't flash blank
- clamp to \`[0, totalRows - 1]\` — never index past the list

\`\`\`js
visibleRange(0, 40, 400, 10000, 3)      // { start: 0, end: 13 }
visibleRange(4000, 40, 400, 10000, 3)   // { start: 97, end: 113 }
\`\`\`

    title: "CSS specificity calculator",
    description: `**Specificity** is how the browser breaks ties when several CSS rules target the same element. It's the answer to "why isn't my style applying?"

## The problem

Two rules set the same button's color — which wins? Not "the last one written" and not "the most code". The browser scores each selector and the higher score wins. Guess wrong and you reach for \`!important\`, which just moves the fight somewhere worse.

## The idea

Every selector gets a three-part score — **[id, class, element]** — counted most-powerful first:

- **id**: \`#cta\` → IDs
- **class**: \`.btn\`, \`[type="text"]\`, \`:hover\` → classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes
- **element**: \`button\`, \`::before\` → type selectors and pseudo-elements

Compare the tuples left to right: \`[1,0,0]\` (one ID) beats \`[0,2,0]\` (two classes), which beats \`[0,0,5]\` (five elements). The universal selector \`*\` and combinators (\`>\`, \`+\`, \`~\`) score nothing.

## Your task

Write \`specificity(selector)\` returning a \`[id, class, element]\` tuple:

\`\`\`js
specificity("#cta")             // [1, 0, 0]
specificity(".btn.primary")     // [0, 2, 0]
specificity("button#cta.btn")   // [1, 1, 1]
specificity("[type='text']")    // [0, 1, 0]
\`\`\`

> **One ID beats a hundred classes.** Specificity is compared column by column, never summed — \`[1,0,0]\` always wins over \`[0,99,0]\`. That's exactly why an ID selector is so hard to override.

      "JavaScript is single-threaded — only one piece of code runs at a time. The event loop is the mechanism that lets it handle async work (timers, network requests, user events) without blocking. It continuously checks the call stack; when the stack is empty, it processes the microtask queue fully, then picks one task from the task queue, runs it to completion, and repeats.\n\nThis matters because blocking the call stack for even a few hundred milliseconds will make the UI unresponsive — the event loop is what lets JavaScript appear concurrent.",

So any inline style beats any selector-based rule, no matter how specific the selector is.\n\nThe only thing that overrides an inline style is a declaration marked `!important` in a stylesheet.

Properties that trigger layout (`width`, `top`, `margin`, `font-size`) are costlier to animate than paint-only properties (`color`, `background`).\n\nThe cheapest changes are **composite-only** — `transform` and `opacity` — because they can be handled by the GPU without re-running layout or paint.

When you access a property, the engine first checks the object itself, then walks the prototype chain until it finds the property or reaches `null`.\n\nYou set up inheritance by linking prototypes: `Object.create(parentProto)` creates an object whose `[[Prototype]]` is `parentProto`. The `class` syntax is syntactic sugar over this mechanism — `extends` sets up the prototype chain and `super()` calls the parent constructor. Understanding the underlying chain explains why `instanceof` works, why methods can be shared across instances, and what `hasOwnProperty` guards against.",

    question: "What is a closure and when would you use one?",
    answer:
      "A closure is a function that retains access to the variables from its defining scope, even after that scope has returned. Every function in JavaScript closes over its surrounding scope.\n\nCommon uses:\n- **Private state** — module pattern, encapsulating variables that shouldn't be directly accessible\n- **Partial application / currying** — baking some arguments into a function\n- **Event handlers** — the handler closes over the relevant state at setup time\n- **Memoization** — a closure holds the cache object\n\nThe gotcha: all closures from the same scope share the same variable binding, so closures created in a `for` loop with `var` all see the final value of the loop variable unless you use `let` or an IIFE.",

The loop takes **one** task per iteration.\n\nThe order each loop iteration: run one task → drain all microtasks → render (if needed) → repeat.

So `setTimeout(fn, 0)` really means \"run `fn` after the current execution and all pending microtasks complete,\" which is a common trick to defer work until after the current call stack unwinds.",

      "`async`/`await` is syntax over promises, so it runs on the **microtask** queue. When execution hits `await`, the async function pauses and returns control to the caller; everything *after* the `await` is scheduled as a microtask that resumes once the awaited value settles.\n\n```js\nasync function f() {\n  console.log('a');\n  await null;        // suspend here\n  console.log('b');  // resumes as a microtask\n}\nf();\nconsole.log('c');\n// logs: a, c, b\n```\n\nSo code after `await` never runs synchronously — it always yields to the microtask queue first, even when awaiting an already-resolved value.",

To stabilize callbacks and objects passed as props (so `memo` actually helps), use `useCallback` and `useMemo`. The most common performance mistake is adding `memo`/`useCallback` before profiling — they have overhead too.",

Otherwise, prefer `useEffect` — it doesn't block painting.\n\nPractical rule: start with `useEffect`. If you see a flicker on initial render, consider `useLayoutEffect`. On the server, `useLayoutEffect` does not run at all — prefer `useEffect` for SSR-safe logic.",

Without stable keys, React resorts to positional matching, which causes incorrect updates (and subtle bugs) when items are reordered or added at the beginning\n\nThe algorithm runs in O(n) time by making two assumptions: elements of different types produce different trees, and keys identify stable elements across renders.",

While waiting, React shows a fallback UI defined by the nearest `<Suspense fallback={...}>` boundary.\n\nHow it works: a component 'suspends' by throwing a Promise. React catches it, renders the fallback, and retries the component when the Promise resolves. You don't throw the Promise manually — libraries like React Query, Relay, or `React.lazy` do it for you.\n\n```jsx\nconst LazyChart = React.lazy(() => import('./Chart'));\n<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>\n  <LazyChart />\n</Suspense>\n```\n\nIn React 18+, Suspense integrates with concurrent features — it enables streaming SSR (rendering the shell immediately, streaming shell content as it resolves) and transitions (keeping the current UI visible while the next route loads).",

Keep it as close to the consuming component as possible.\n\n3. **HTTP caching** — set correct `Cache-Control` headers on API responses. `stale-while-revalidate` allows serving a cached response while fetching a fresh one.\n\n4. **Persistent cache** — for offline support or faster first paint, serialise the React Query cache to `localStorage`/`IndexedDB` on unload and restore it on load (react-query's `persistQueryClient` plugin).\n\n**Cache invalidation strategy:** invalidate by tag (not by URL) — after a mutation, mark all queries with a given tag as stale so they refetch on next access.
